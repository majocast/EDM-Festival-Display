-Learned more dynamic webscraping rather than just scraping through a preset table established by hard code. Learned about url authorization requests in order to access function created html elements. 

-Creation of WebScraper2.java & WebScraper3.java
    -Upgraded webscraper concept that uses url/https access authorization to access a loaded version of the automatically updating web pages and pull information via understanding select() functions and UBlock's cosmetic highlighting.

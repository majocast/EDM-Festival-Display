-Creation of project

Concept: A computer application that displays relevant information regarding EDM concerts in a specified area.
-Target Area: California (Bay Area)
-Target Audience: Preferably young adults, current test audience will be my friends.

-Creation of Event.java, Index.java, Storage.java

-Event.java
    -Class object that stores the information for a specific event object and makes the information retrievable.
-Index.java
    -Will serve as main function running to organize, store, and make the data accessible to user.
-Storage.java
    -Storage complex by means of HashMap. Accessible class object when we need to access all the inputted values with their respective keys.

-Creation of WebScraper.java
    -Baseline webscraper that pulls EDM festival information from a website I have specified. Emphasis on festival, normal concerts are not included in this website's listing.

1/14-16/2023
-Learned more dynamic webscraping rather than just scraping through a preset table established by hard code. Learned about url authorization requests in order to access function created html elements. 

-Creation of WebScraper2.java & WebScraper3.java
    -Upgraded webscraper concept that uses url/https access authorization to access a loaded version of the automatically updating web pages and pull information via understanding select() functions and UBlock's cosmetic highlighting.

1/17/2023

-Started implementation of WebScraper.java into Storage.java to pull data from the created text sheet and plug in values into the dataMap. 
-Making changes to WebScraper.java to pull data regarding date and location in order to put those into the created Event object that is inserted into the Data Map.

1/21/2023

-Moved all webscrapers into one scraper class
-deleted a webscraper, now using 2 websites as data pool is large enough
-fixed storage implementation to make dataMap available to pass between all classes
-moved file creation from webscraper to FileCreate.java
-updated Event.java to not include price as prices vary from providers
-updated scraping methods to find individual pieces and apply them to fields in the event class/dataMap additions
-deleted majority of commented out code that was unnecessary
-added JTable to Index.java to display current Data

1/22/2023
-included text bar for searching for items
-started work with Table Sorter implementation
-Have last working version of JTable commented out, working on new version with filtering options.

1/27/2023
-fixed filter, just very case sensitive
-finished elementary code cleaning.

PROJECT TECHNICALLY COMPLETE (1/27/2023)

Potential Improvements later on:
-Making the filter less sensitive
-Re-formating dates to all be the same format
-creating a graph methodology to display events (dates on x-axis, price on y-axis)
-improvements on webscraper to potentially look for best price for each event
